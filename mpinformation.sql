It is situated on the eastern bank of the Kshipra River. Ujjain is one of the seven sacred cities (Sapta Puri) of the Hindus, and the <a href="http://www.simhasthujjain.in/" target="_blank">Kumbh Mela</a> religious festival is held there every 12 years. It is also home to Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga, one of the twelve Jyotirlinga shrines to the god Shiva and is also the place where Lord Krishna got education.\r\n\r\nSculptures and monasteries have been found sprinkled around Ujjain, leading to the credence that Buddhism thrived here in the 4th century. Ujjain''s relevance is not constrained to the small circle of a religious place. Apart from that, this city was a haven of astronomers, and great poets. Besides this Ujjain was ruled over by many greatest rulers who have given out their best to this historic city. The illustrious kings of the Gupta dynasty whose reign is considered as the golden rule of India belonged to Ujjain.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Simhasth Kumbh Mahaparv” is one of the four “Kumbh Melas” celebrated by largest spiritual gathering on Planet Earth. Simhasth Kumbh Mahaparv is rejoiced by holy dip in the sacred river Kshipra in ancient and religious city Ujjain (Madhya Pradesh).Simhasth Kumbh Maha Parva is based on the celestial line-up of Planets and the Signs of the Zodiac, which occurs every 12 years.\r\n\r\n“Kumbh” in its literal English translation means “Pot”, which emerged from “Samudra Manthan”(Churning of the Ocean) between Gods and Devils. The term ‘Mela‘ signifies’Fair‘.\r\n\r\nKumbh Mahaparv is held at four places in India – Haridwar, Prayag (Allahabad), Ujjain and Nasik. At Ujjain, Kumbh Mahaparv is specifically called “Simhasth Kumbh Mahaparv” because the Sun (in Sanskrit “Surya”) is in the zodiac Aries (“Mesh” in Sanskrit) and the Jupiter (“Brahaspati” in Sanskrit) is in the zodiac Leo (in Sanskrit “Simha”) when it takes place. There are ten unique and uncommon yogs which exist and facilitate the organizing of Simhasth Kumbh Mahaparv.\r\n\r\nThis time Simhasth Kumbh Mahaparv is going to take place from April 22nd to May 21st 2016(in Sanskrit Chaitra Shukla Purnima – Vaishakha Shukla Purnima, Vikram Samvat 2073). The holy dip in river Kshipra is taken on the auspicious day at a defined time at which it is believed that ‘Nectar’ from ‘Kumbh’ was dropped in the pious river. It is believed that taking a dip in river Kshipra on this ocassion purifies the soul and overcomes all the sins.\r\n\r\nAround 5 Crore (50 Millions) pilgrims from all walks of life are expected to join and take holy dip. Pilgrims visit the “Mahakaleshwar” Jyotirlinga and other ancient temples in and around Ujjain and thereafter they find spiritual solace in ‘Satsang’ and ‘Sankirtan’ in Mahaparv Kshetra (Mela Kshetra) with great Sadhus.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, Simhasth Kumbh Mahaparv is celebrated by various Akharas, where “Peshwai” (Procession) begins in its full glory. The heads of Akharas join the procession on silver throne (Simhasanam) on elephants. It looks magnificent with the presence of armed Sadhus on horses and camels followed by Sadhus, hermits and devotees. Peshwai completes at the Ram Ghat area on the banks of river Kshipra.\r\n\r\nBased on the interest of visitors various “itineraries ” are being planned, which include -\r\n\r\n“Ancient Temples”,\r\n“Historical Monuments”,\r\n“Heritage Walk,\r\nUjjain District as “Agricultural (Biological and Natural) Production & Processing Centre”,\r\n“Educational Hub”,\r\n“Migratory Bird Spots”.\r\n“Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” (Sanskrit: वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम) – India’s philosophy Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, or world family has guided the nation since Vedic times. Heartening to note that over the past few years many other Sampraday (sects) other than Sanatan Dharma are participating in Simhasth Kumbh with the same enthusiasm and harmony as the Sadhus and pilgrims of Sanatan Dharma. The efforts are on to bring the golden days back when Ujjain was the Capital of the region from Egypt to Indonesia. This festival perfectly shows the diversity and unity of rich Indian culture.\r\n\r\nCome and join the once in a lifetime experience & enlighten your mind, body and soul.\r\n\r\n<h3>Top Place in Ujjain</h3>\r\n<h4>Shri Mahakaleshwar Temple</h4>\r\n<h4>Kal Bhairav Temple</h4>\r\n<h4>Harsiddhi Temple</h4>\r\n<h4>Mangalnath Temple</h4>\r\n<h4>Sandipani Ashram</h4>\r\n<h4>Chintaman Ganesh Temple</h4>\r\n<h4>Gadkalika Temple</h4>\r\n<h4>Bade Ganeshji Ka Mandir</h4>\r\n<h4>ISKCON Temple</h4>\r\n<h4>Gopal Mandir Temple</h4>\r\n<h4>Jantar Mantar</h4>\r\n<h4>Bhartrihari Caves</h4>\r\n<h4>Ram Mandir Ghat</h4>\r\n<h4>Siddhavat</h4>\r\n<h4>Navagraha Mandir</h4>\r\n<h4>Kalideh Palace</h4>\r\n<h4>Vikram University</h4>\r\n<h4>Kalidasa Academy</h4>\r\n<h4>Ram Mandir</h4>\r\n<h4>Chaubis Khamba Temple</h4>\r\n<h4>Pir Matsyendranath</h4>\r\n<h4>Vikrant Bhairav Shrine</h4>', 'Ujjain', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'ujjain-is-the-largest-city-in-ujjain-district-of-the-indian-state-of-madhya-pradesh-it-is-the-administrative-center-of-ujjain-district-and-ujjain-division', '', '', '2016-02-15 21:09:56', '2016-02-15 21:09:56', '', 0, 'http://192.168.30.74/wordpress/?p=1', 0, 'post', '', 0),

(22, 1, '2016-01-29 07:39:20', '2016-01-29 07:39:20', 'Gwalior, a city in Madhya Pradesh is famous for both. The bravery the rulers and the people displayed in the past stands proof for their valor and the love for arts and architecture is evident from the city’s monuments. A city with rich historic significance, the place gives you a clear insight on the display of strength by the rulers of the bygone era. Gwalior has stood the test of time and your visit to Gwalior is sure to elevate your spirits. While you are in this city, ensure that you do not miss the following 5 places to visit in Gwalior.\r\n\r\n<h3>About Gwalior</h3>\r\nGwalior''s tradition as a royal capital continued until the formation of present day India, with the Scindias having their dynastic seat here. The magnificent mementoes of a glorious past have been preserved with care, giving Gwalior an appeal unique and timeless. Gwalior''s history is traced back to a legend. In 8 A.D, a chieftain called Suraj Sen was stricken by a deadly disease. He was cured by a hermit saint, Gwalipa, and in gratitude founded a city which he named after the saint who had given him the gift of new life. The new city of Gwalior became, over the centuries, the cradle of great dynasties and with each, the city gained new dimensions from warrior kings, poets, musicians and saints, contributing to making it a capital renowned throughout the country.Since then, Gwalior is considered to be a city where a rich cultural tradition has been interwoven into the fabric of modern life. Also where a princely past lives on in great palaces and their museums. And where a multitude of images merge and mix to present to the visitor a city of enduring greatness.\r\n\r\n<h3>TELI KA MANDIR</h3>\r\nThe Teli ka Mandir is a 9th century edifice, towering at 100 ft high. This is a Pratihara Vishnu temple of a unique blending of architectural styles. The shape of the roof is distinctively Dravidian, while the decorative embellishments have the typically Indo-Aryan characteristics of Northern India. Also dedicated to Vishnu is the graceful little Sas-Bahu-ka-Mandir, built in 11th century. Another landmark is the historic Gurudwara Data Bandhi Chhod built in the memory of Guru Hargobind Sahib, the 6th Sikh Guru who was imprisoned here by Jehangir for over two years. At the time of his release, he wanted 52 Hindu kings who were his fellow prisoners, released with him. Jehangir was very impressed with the Guru and agreed to his condition. And, finally, within the Fort complex, housed in the erstwhile barracks of the British soldiers, is Gwalior''s unique gift to modern India : Scindia School. Acknowledged as one of the finest schools in India, it is only fitting that the country''s young citizens receive the best educational grounding surrounded by monuments to a past which is a constant inspiration. \r\n\r\n<h3>JAI VILAS PALACE</h3>\r\nA splendour of a different kind exists in the Jai Vilas Palace, current residence of the Scindia family. Some 35 rooms have been made into the Scindia Museum, and in these rooms, so evocative of a regal lifestyle, the past comes alive. Jai Vilas is an Italianate structure which combines the Tuscan and Corinthian architectural modes. The imposing Darbar Hall has two central chandeliers, weighing a couple of tonnes, and hung only after ten elephants had tested the strength of the roof.\r\n\r\n<h3>Top places to visit in Gwalior</h3>\r\n[gallery ids="270,271,272,262"]', 'Gwalior', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'gwalior-fort-is-an-8th-century-hill-fort-near-gwalior-madhya-pradesh-central-india-the-fort-consists-of-a-defensive-structure-and-two-main-palaces-gurjari-mahal-and-man-mandir-built-by-man-singh', '', '', '2016-02-21 22:53:49', '2016-02-21 22:53:49', '', 0, 'http://192.168.30.74/wordpress/?p=22', 0, 'post', '', 0),

While you are in this city, ensure that you do not miss the following 5 places to visit in Gwalior.\r\n\r\n<h3>About Gwalior</h3>\r\nGwalior''s tradition as a royal capital continued until the formation of present day India, with the Scindias having their dynastic seat here. The magnificent mementoes of a glorious past have been preserved with care, giving Gwalior an appeal unique and timeless. Gwalior''s history is traced back to a legend. In 8 A.D, a chieftain called Suraj Sen was stricken by a deadly disease. He was cured by a hermit saint, Gwalipa, and in gratitude founded a city which he named after the saint who had given him the gift of new life. The new city of Gwalior became, over the centuries, the cradle of great dynasties and with each, the city gained new dimensions from warrior kings, poets, musicians and saints, contributing to making it a capital renowned throughout the country.Since then, Gwalior is considered to be a city where a rich cultural tradition has been interwoven into the fabric of modern life. Also where a princely past lives on in great palaces and their museums. And where a multitude of images merge and mix to present to the visitor a city of enduring greatness.\r\n\r\n<h3>TELI KA MANDIR</h3>\r\nThe Teli ka Mandir is a 9th century edifice, towering at 100 ft high. This is a Pratihara Vishnu temple of a unique blending of architectural styles. The shape of the roof is distinctively Dravidian, while the decorative embellishments have the typically Indo-Aryan characteristics of Northern India. Also dedicated to Vishnu is the graceful little Sas-Bahu-ka-Mandir, built in 11th century. Another landmark is the historic Gurudwara Data Bandhi Chhod built in the memory of Guru Hargobind Sahib, the 6th Sikh Guru who was imprisoned here by Jehangir for over two years. At the time of his release, he wanted 52 Hindu kings who were his fellow prisoners, released with him. Jehangir was very impressed with the Guru and agreed to his condition. And, finally, within the Fort complex, housed in the erstwhile barracks of the British soldiers, is Gwalior''s unique gift to modern India : Scindia School. Acknowledged as one of the finest schools in India, it is only fitting that the country''s young citizens receive the best educational grounding surrounded by monuments to a past which is a constant inspiration. \r\n\r\n<h3>JAI VILAS PALACE</h3>\r\nA splendour of a different kind exists in the Jai Vilas Palace, current residence of the Scindia family. Some 35 rooms have been made into the Scindia Museum, and in these rooms, so evocative of a regal lifestyle, the past comes alive. Jai Vilas is an Italianate structure which combines the Tuscan and Corinthian architectural modes. The imposing Darbar Hall has two central chandeliers, weighing a couple of tonnes, and hung only after ten elephants had tested the strength of the roof.\r\n\r\n<h3>Top places to visit in Gwalior</h3>\r\n[gallery ids="270,271,272,262"]\r\n', 'Top Place in Gwalior', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'top-place-in-gwalior', '', '', '2016-02-15 20:51:21', '2016-02-15 20:51:21', '', 0, 'http://www.mpinformation.com/?p=303', 0, 'post', '', 0);

(338, 1, '2016-02-10 04:28:00', '2016-02-10 04:28:00', '<h3>About Of Shivpuri</h3>\r\nShivpuri is a historical town in the northern part of the state of Madhya Pradesh. The town was apparently named after Lord Shiva. Shivpuri''s ancient historical heritage is still alive with remnants of its mansions, palaces, streets and lodges still intact. The hills surrounding Shivpuri and its pleasant climate make it an ideal tourist getaway. \r\n\r\n<h3>History Of Chhatari</h3>\r\nChhatari (memorial or cenotaph) made of ornate marble is a fine example of workmanship.\r\nIts campus is on Chhatari Road which leads from Do Battai Chauraha to Bhadaiya Kund. As we enter in the campus of Chhatari ,we view first memorial of dowager queen Maharani Sakhya Raje Scindia, in a delighful fusion of Hindu and Islamic architectural styles, with their shikhara type spires and Rajput and Mughal pavilions.A tank is created in front of this memorial.The memorial of Madhav Rav Scindhia is built across the tank facing to wards Maharani Sakhya Raje Scindhia.One side of the tank a temple is established of Lord Ram with Seeta , Lakshman and other side a temple is established of Radha- Krishna. All memorials & temples are built by Scindhia Princes of Gwalior. Management of Chhatari is under control of a registered trust.\r\n\r\n<h3>History Of Madhav National Park</h3>\r\nThe Madhav National Park is situated on the northern fringe of the Central Highlands of India. It is a part of the upper Vindhyan hills, forming plateaus, and having small and big nallas. The slopes are generally gentle, rarely steep. Spreading over an area of almost 355 sq.kms., the Madhav National Park is fascinating mix of natural splendors of history and architectural wonders. The park, one of the oldest, is situated in the northern part of Madhya Pradesh, near Shivpuri town. Madhav got the status of a National Park in 1958.\r\n\r\nThe park is unique in having both lake and forest ecosystems. Sakhya and Madhav Sagar are the two lakes in the park, which are important biodiversity support systems. These lakes not only add to the natural beauty of the area, but also provide a permanent source of water to the wildlife, and a fine wetland habitat to the aquatic fauna including thousands of migratory waterfowls. Marsh Crocodiles are in abundance in Sakhya sagar lake. Due to this, the lake looks like a "Crocodile Safari" and attracts special attention of tourists.\r\n\r\nThe park represents the Northern Tropical dry deciduous mixed forest type, as well as dry thorn forest, typical of North-Western Madhya Pradesh. The forests here are home to antelopes like Nilgai, Chinkara and Chowsinga and Deer including Chital, Sambar and Barking Deer. One can see animals like the Leopard, Wolf, Jackal, Fox, Wild Dog, Wild Pig, Porcupine, Marsh Crocodile and the Python.\r\n\r\nHaving a varied terrain of wooded hills, dry, mixed deciduous forests, and flat grasslands around the lakes, the park offers abundant opportunities of sighting a variety of wildlife.\r\n\r\nShivpuri town in the state of Madhya Pradesh was once the summer capital and the former hunting preserve of the Maharaja of Gwalior. Even before this, during the reign of the Mughals, its dense forests were the hunting grounds of the Mughal emperors. Large herds of elephants were captured here by Emperor Akbar. Since the area was a Royal shooting reserve, it was well protected, and abounded with wild life and was famous for its tigers. Tigers and other animals were known to wander in great numbers in the area. It is reported that in 1916, Lord Hardinge shot eight tigers in one day at Shivpuri. Lord Minto supposed to have shot 19 tigers during his trip to Gwalior state. The last of the resident wild tigers were seen in Madhav National Park around late 1970. Owing to dedicated efforts the habitat has become secure and improved now that the transient tigers are tempted to become resident. One male and one female tiger have once again made Madhav their home since october 2007.\r\n\r\nOn the shores of Sakhya Sagar lake which edges the forests, is a Boat Club, from where the park visitors can see a number of migratory birds especially in winter, when a large number of migratory waterfowls visit the area. A viewing lodge constructed  by the Maharaja called the Shooting Box, is situated above the Sakhya Sagar lake.  In the older days one could shoot wildlife, both with a gun and camera from here. Visitors could sit under cover and watch a tiger at a kill.\r\nAll around the lake (at suitable points), the Maharaja constructed boat landing areas, picnic shelters, watch towers, hides etc. and a network of well laid out metalled roads.\r\n\r\nDeep inside the Madhav National Park, at its highest point, stands the exquisite George Castle at a height of almost 484 m (1597 feet). Interestingly the castle was built by Jivaji Rao Scindia of the Gwalior royal family for an overnight halt for tiger  shooting by the British King George V, when he was to pass that way during his visit to India in 1911. Ironically, it so happened that the emperor could shoot a tiger on the way itself and did not stop at Madhav. Tunda Bharka spring, Bhura-kho spring and watch tower, and Churanchaj ancient wall paintings are beautiful sites to visit.\r\n\r\n<h2>Top Attraction Place in Shivpuri</h2>\r\n\r\n[gallery ids="349,346,352,351,347,348,350,339,341,345,340,344,343,342,345"]\r\n', 'Shivpuri', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'shivpuri-2', '', '', '2016-02-20 11:51:47', '2016-02-20 11:51:47', '', 0, 'http://www.mpinformation.com/?p=338', 0, 'post', '', 0),

It is situated on the eastern bank of the Kshipra River. Ujjain is one of the seven sacred cities (Sapta Puri) of the Hindus, and the <a href="http://www.simhasthujjain.in/" target="_blank">Kumbh Mela</a> religious festival is held there every 12 years. It is also home to Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga, one of the twelve Jyotirlinga shrines to the god Shiva and is also the place where Lord Krishna got education.\r\n\r\nSculptures and monasteries have been found sprinkled around Ujjain, leading to the credence that Buddhism thrived here in the 4th century. Ujjain''s relevance is not constrained to the small circle of a religious place. Apart from that, this city was a haven of astronomers, and great poets. Besides this Ujjain was ruled over by many greatest rulers who have given out their best to this historic city. The illustrious kings of the Gupta dynasty whose reign is considered as the golden rule of India belonged to Ujjain.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Simhasth Kumbh Mahaparv” is one of the four “Kumbh Melas” celebrated by largest spiritual gathering on Planet Earth. Simhasth Kumbh Mahaparv is rejoiced by holy dip in the sacred river Kshipra in ancient and religious city Ujjain (Madhya Pradesh).Simhasth Kumbh Maha Parva is based on the celestial line-up of Planets and the Signs of the Zodiac, which occurs every 12 years.\r\n\r\n“Kumbh” in its literal English translation means “Pot”, which emerged from “Samudra Manthan”(Churning of the Ocean) between Gods and Devils. The term ‘Mela‘ signifies’Fair‘.\r\n\r\nKumbh Mahaparv is held at four places in India – Haridwar, Prayag (Allahabad), Ujjain and Nasik. At Ujjain, Kumbh Mahaparv is specifically called “Simhasth Kumbh Mahaparv” because the Sun (in Sanskrit “Surya”) is in the zodiac Aries (“Mesh” in Sanskrit) and the Jupiter (“Brahaspati” in Sanskrit) is in the zodiac Leo (in Sanskrit “Simha”) when it takes place. There are ten unique and uncommon yogs which exist and facilitate the organizing of Simhasth Kumbh Mahaparv.\r\n\r\nThis time Simhasth Kumbh Mahaparv is going to take place from April 22nd to May 21st 2016(in Sanskrit Chaitra Shukla Purnima – Vaishakha Shukla Purnima, Vikram Samvat 2073). The holy dip in river Kshipra is taken on the auspicious day at a defined time at which it is believed that ‘Nectar’ from ‘Kumbh’ was dropped in the pious river. It is believed that taking a dip in river Kshipra on this ocassion purifies the soul and overcomes all the sins.\r\n\r\nAround 5 Crore (50 Millions) pilgrims from all walks of life are expected to join and take holy dip. Pilgrims visit the “Mahakaleshwar” Jyotirlinga and other ancient temples in and around Ujjain and thereafter they find spiritual solace in ‘Satsang’ and ‘Sankirtan’ in Mahaparv Kshetra (Mela Kshetra) with great Sadhus.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, Simhasth Kumbh Mahaparv is celebrated by various Akharas, where “Peshwai” (Procession) begins in its full glory. The heads of Akharas join the procession on silver throne (Simhasanam) on elephants.

In March 1971, Shri & Smt. Shitla Sahai had lost their only son Rajiv, who was suffering from osteosarcoma sarcoma. Hardly any facilities were available then in Gwalior for the treatment of cancer. Undaunted by the grief, this family vowed to start a Cancer Hospital to provide benefit to cancer patients in Gwalior. With this aim in view, a charitable trust “Jan Vikas Nyas” was founded in May 1971. Surmounting difficulties and with untiring efforts of the bereaved family, Cancer Hospital was Started in 1977, which has gradually developed to a modern Cancer Hospital with facilities for comprehensive management of cancer.\r\n\r\n<h3>Hospital Location in Gwalior</h3>\r\nGovernment of Madhya Pradesh had been generous to allot 266 acres of land for this noble cause on a hill top of Mandre Ki Mata. The construction of the main hospital building and hostel for patient’s attendants was taken up initially and then the full campus with all amenities developed in phased manner. The institute was recognized as early as in 1980, as one of then 10 regional Cancer Centers for Research and Treatment and only one in Madhya Pradesh by the Government of India. \r\n\r\nThe Institute is serving not only to the people of Madhya Pradesh, but also from the neighboring districts of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan besides, some patients coming even from far distant states. With meagre resources at hand and with generous though a limited quantity of Grant-in -aid from Government of India and some contributions from Government of Madhya Pradesh, the institute, which started from scratch, has developed into a modern hospital for diagnosis and treatment of cancer.\r\n\r\nAddress : Cancer Pahadi, Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh\r\nPhone   : 0751 233 6502\r\nWebsite : <a href="http://cancerhospitalgwalior.com/" target="_blank">http://cancerhospitalgwalior.com/</a>', 'Cancer Hospital Gwalior', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'cancer-hospital-gwalior', '', '', '2016-02-15 20:38:43', '2016-02-15 20:38:43', '', 0, 'http://www.mpinformation.com/?p=378', 0, 'post', '', 0),

The park, one of the oldest, is situated in the northern part of Madhya Pradesh, near Shivpuri town. Madhav got the status of a National Park in 1958.\r\n\r\nThe park is unique in having both lake and forest ecosystems. Sakhya and Madhav Sagar are the two lakes in the park, which are important biodiversity support systems. These lakes not only add to the natural beauty of the area, but also provide a permanent source of water to the wildlife, and a fine wetland habitat to the aquatic fauna including thousands of migratory waterfowls. Marsh Crocodiles are in abundance in Sakhya sagar lake. Due to this, the lake looks like a "Crocodile Safari" and attracts special attention of tourists.\r\n\r\nThe park represents the Northern Tropical dry deciduous mixed forest type, as well as dry thorn forest, typical of North-Western Madhya Pradesh. The forests here are home to antelopes like Nilgai, Chinkara and Chowsinga and Deer including Chital, Sambar and Barking Deer. One can see animals like the Leopard, Wolf, Jackal, Fox, Wild Dog, Wild Pig, Porcupine, Marsh Crocodile and the Python.\r\n\r\nHaving a varied terrain of wooded hills, dry, mixed deciduous forests, and flat grasslands around the lakes, the park offers abundant opportunities of sighting a variety of wildlife.\r\n\r\nShivpuri town in the state of Madhya Pradesh was once the summer capital and the former hunting preserve of the Maharaja of Gwalior. Even before this, during the reign of the Mughals, its dense forests were the hunting grounds of the Mughal emperors. Large herds of elephants were captured here by Emperor Akbar. Since the area was a Royal shooting reserve, it was well protected, and abounded with wild life and was famous for its tigers.

Owing to dedicated efforts the habitat has become secure and improved now that the transient tigers are tempted to become resident. One male and one female tiger have once again made Madhav their home since october 2007.\r\n\r\nOn the shores of Sakhya Sagar lake which edges the forests, is a Boat Club, from where the park visitors can see a number of migratory birds especially in winter, when a large number of migratory waterfowls visit the area. A viewing lodge constructed  by the Maharaja called the Shooting Box, is situated above the Sakhya Sagar lake.  In the older days one could shoot wildlife, both with a gun and camera from here. Visitors could sit under cover and watch a tiger at a kill.\r\nAll around the lake (at suitable points), the Maharaja constructed boat landing areas, picnic shelters, watch towers, hides etc. and a network of well laid out metalled roads.\r\n\r\nDeep inside the Madhav National Park, at its highest point, stands the exquisite George Castle at a height of almost 484 m (1597 feet). Interestingly the castle was built by Jivaji Rao Scindia of the Gwalior royal family for an overnight halt for tiger  shooting by the British King George V, when he was to pass that way during his visit to India in 1911. Ironically, it so happened that the emperor could shoot a tiger on the way itself and did not stop at Madhav. Tunda Bharka spring, Bhura-kho spring and watch tower, and Churanchaj ancient wall paintings are beautiful sites to visit.\r\n\r\n<h2>Top Attraction Place in Shivpuri</h2>\r\n\r\n[gallery ids="349,346,352,351,347,348,350,339,341,345,340,344,343,342,345"]\r\n', 'Top Place in Shivpuri', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '338-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-02-15 21:08:04', '2016-02-15 21:08:04', '', 338, 'http://www.mpinformation.com/338-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(424, 1, '2016-02-15 21:09:56', '2016-02-15 21:09:56', 'Ujjain (also known as Ujain, Ujjayini, Avanti, Avantikapuri),is an district in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. It is situated on the eastern bank of the Kshipra River. Ujjain is one of the seven sacred cities (Sapta Puri) of the Hindus, and the <a href="http://www.simhasthujjain.in/" target="_blank">Kumbh Mela</a> religious festival is held there every 12 years. It is also home to Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga, one of the twelve Jyotirlinga shrines to the god Shiva and is also the place where Lord Krishna got education.\r\n\r\nSculptures and monasteries have been found sprinkled around Ujjain, leading to the credence that Buddhism thrived here in the 4th century. Ujjain''s relevance is not constrained to the small circle of a religious place. Apart from that, this city was a haven of astronomers, and great poets. Besides this Ujjain was ruled over by many greatest rulers who have given out their best to this historic city. The illustrious kings of the Gupta dynasty whose reign is considered as the golden rule of India belonged to Ujjain.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Simhasth Kumbh Mahaparv” is one of the four “Kumbh Melas” celebrated by largest spiritual gathering on Planet Earth. Simhasth Kumbh Mahaparv is rejoiced by holy dip in the sacred river Kshipra in ancient and religious city Ujjain (Madhya Pradesh).Simhasth Kumbh Maha Parva is based on the celestial line-up of Planets and the Signs of the Zodiac, which occurs every 12 years.\r\n\r\n“Kumbh” in its literal English translation means “Pot”, which emerged from “Samudra Manthan”(Churning of the Ocean) between Gods and Devils. The term ‘Mela‘ signifies’Fair‘.\r\n\r\nKumbh Mahaparv is held at four places in India – Haridwar, Prayag (Allahabad), Ujjain and Nasik. At Ujjain, Kumbh Mahaparv is specifically called “Simhasth Kumbh Mahaparv” because the Sun (in Sanskrit “Surya”) is in the zodiac Aries (“Mesh” in Sanskrit) and the Jupiter (“Brahaspati” in Sanskrit) is in the zodiac Leo (in Sanskrit “Simha”) when it takes place. There are ten unique and uncommon yogs which exist and facilitate the organizing of Simhasth Kumbh Mahaparv.\r\n\r\nThis time Simhasth Kumbh Mahaparv is going to take place from April 22nd to May 21st 2016(in Sanskrit Chaitra Shukla Purnima – Vaishakha Shukla Purnima, Vikram Samvat 2073). The holy dip in river Kshipra is taken on the auspicious day at a defined time at which it is believed that ‘Nectar’ from ‘Kumbh’ was dropped in the pious river. It is believed that taking a dip in river Kshipra on this ocassion purifies the soul and overcomes all the sins.\r\n\r\nAround 5 Crore (50 Millions) pilgrims from all walks of life are expected to join and take holy dip. Pilgrims visit the “Mahakaleshwar” Jyotirlinga and other ancient temples in and around Ujjain and thereafter they find spiritual solace in ‘Satsang’ and ‘Sankirtan’ in Mahaparv Kshetra (Mela Kshetra) with great Sadhus.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, Simhasth Kumbh Mahaparv is celebrated by various Akharas, where “Peshwai” (Procession) begins in its full glory. The heads of Akharas join the procession on silver throne (Simhasanam) on elephants. It looks magnificent with the presence of armed Sadhus on horses and camels followed by Sadhus, hermits and devotees. Peshwai completes at the Ram Ghat area on the banks of river Kshipra.\r\n\r\nBased on the interest of visitors various “itineraries ” are being planned, which include -\r\n\r\n“Ancient Temples”,\r\n“Historical Monuments”,\r\n“Heritage Walk,\r\nUjjain District as “Agricultural (Biological and Natural) Production & Processing Centre”,\r\n“Educational Hub”,\r\n“Migratory Bird Spots”.\r\n“Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” (Sanskrit: वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम) – India’s philosophy Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, or world family has guided the nation since Vedic times. Heartening to note that over the past few years many other Sampraday (sects) other than Sanatan Dharma are participating in Simhasth Kumbh with the same enthusiasm and harmony as the Sadhus and pilgrims of Sanatan Dharma. The efforts are on to bring the golden days back when Ujjain was the Capital of the region from Egypt to Indonesia. This festival perfectly shows the diversity and unity of rich Indian culture.\r\n\r\nCome and join the once in a lifetime experience & enlighten your mind, body and soul.\r\n\r\n<h3>Top Place in Ujjain</h3>\r\n<h4>Shri Mahakaleshwar Temple</h4>\r\n<h4>Kal Bhairav Temple</h4>\r\n<h4>Harsiddhi Temple</h4>\r\n<h4>Mangalnath Temple</h4>\r\n<h4>Sandipani Ashram</h4>\r\n<h4>Chintaman Ganesh Temple</h4>\r\n<h4>Gadkalika Temple</h4>\r\n<h4>Bade Ganeshji Ka Mandir</h4>\r\n<h4>ISKCON Temple</h4>\r\n<h4>Gopal Mandir Temple</h4>\r\n<h4>Jantar Mantar</h4>\r\n<h4>Bhartrihari Caves</h4>\r\n<h4>Ram Mandir Ghat</h4>\r\n<h4>Siddhavat</h4>\r\n<h4>Navagraha Mandir</h4>\r\n<h4>Kalideh Palace</h4>\r\n<h4>Vikram University</h4>\r\n<h4>Kalidasa Academy</h4>\r\n<h4>Ram Mandir</h4>\r\n<h4>Chaubis Khamba Temple</h4>\r\n<h4>Pir Matsyendranath</h4>\r\n<h4>Vikrant Bhairav Shrine</h4>', 'Ujjain', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '1-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-02-15 21:09:56', '2016-02-15 21:09:56', '', 1, 'http://www.mpinformation.com/1-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The bravery the rulers and the people displayed in the past stands proof for their valor and the love for arts and architecture is evident from the city’s monuments. A city with rich historic significance, the place gives you a clear insight on the display of strength by the rulers of the bygone era. Gwalior has stood the test of time and your visit to Gwalior is sure to elevate your spirits. While you are in this city, ensure that you do not miss the following 5 places to visit in Gwalior.\r\n\r\n<h3>About Gwalior</h3>\r\nGwalior''s tradition as a royal capital continued until the formation of present day India, with the Scindias having their dynastic seat here. The magnificent mementoes of a glorious past have been preserved with care, giving Gwalior an appeal unique and timeless. Gwalior''s history is traced back to a legend. In 8 A.D, a chieftain called Suraj Sen was stricken by a deadly disease. He was cured by a hermit saint, Gwalipa, and in gratitude founded a city which he named after the saint who had given him the gift of new life. The new city of Gwalior became, over the centuries, the cradle of great dynasties and with each, the city gained new dimensions from warrior kings, poets, musicians and saints, contributing to making it a capital renowned throughout the country.Since then, Gwalior is considered to be a city where a rich cultural tradition has been interwoven into the fabric of modern life. Also where a princely past lives on in great palaces and their museums. And where a multitude of images merge and mix to present to the visitor a city of enduring greatness.\r\n\r\n<h3>TELI KA MANDIR</h3>\r\nThe Teli ka Mandir is a 9th century edifice, towering at 100 ft high. This is a Pratihara Vishnu temple of a unique blending of architectural styles. The shape of the roof is distinctively Dravidian, while the decorative embellishments have the typically Indo-Aryan characteristics of Northern India. Also dedicated to Vishnu is the graceful little Sas-Bahu-ka-Mandir, built in 11th century. Another landmark is the historic Gurudwara Data Bandhi Chhod built in the memory of Guru Hargobind Sahib, the 6th Sikh Guru who was imprisoned here by Jehangir for over two years. At the time of his release, he wanted 52 Hindu kings who were his fellow prisoners, released with him. Jehangir was very impressed with the Guru and agreed to his condition. And, finally, within the Fort complex, housed in the erstwhile barracks of the British soldiers, is Gwalior''s unique gift to modern India : Scindia School. Acknowledged as one of the finest schools in India, it is only fitting that the country''s young citizens receive the best educational grounding surrounded by monuments to a past which is a constant inspiration. \r\n\r\n<h3>JAI VILAS PALACE</h3>\r\nA splendour of a different kind exists in the Jai Vilas Palace, current residence of the Scindia family. Some 35 rooms have been made into the Scindia Museum, and in these rooms, so evocative of a regal lifestyle, the past comes alive. Jai Vilas is an Italianate structure which combines the Tuscan and Corinthian architectural modes. The imposing Darbar Hall has two central chandeliers, weighing a couple of tonnes, and hung only after ten elephants had tested the strength of the roof.\r\n\r\n<h3>Top places to visit in Gwalior</h3>\r\n[gallery ids="270,271,272,262"]\r\n', 'Gwalior', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '22-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-02-15 21:19:32', '2016-02-15 21:19:32', '', 22, 'http://www.mpinformation.com/22-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

It occupies nearly the whole width of the satpura range between the valley of the narmada on the north and the bearer plains on the south. It forms the southernmost part of the Bhopal Division. The District extends between 21-22 and 22-24 degrees North Latitude and between 77-10 and 78-33 degrees East Longitude and forms a compact shape, almost a square with slight projection on the East and the West. Two small enclaves of the district, viz., Batla blocks of the Govt. forests lie to the West between the districts of Nimar (East) and Amaraoti. These enclaves lie on the Northern bank of the Tapti. They extent from West to East between the Meridians 77-59 and 77-02.\r\n\r\n<h3>History</h3>\r\nLittle is known of the early history of the district except that it must have been the centre of the first of the four ancient Gond kingdoms of Kherla, Deogarh, Garha-Mandla and Chanda-Sirpur. According to Ferishta, the Persian historian, these kingdoms engrossed in 1398 all the hills of Gondwana and adjacent countries, and were of great wealth and power. About the year 1418 Sultan Hoshang Shah of Malwa invaded Kherla, and reduced it to a dependency. Nine years later the raja rebelled, but although with the help of the Bahmani kings of the Deccan he managed for a time to assert his independence, he was finally subdued and deprived of his territories. In 1467 Kherla was seized by the Bahmani sultan, but was afterwards restored to Malwa. A century later the kingdom of Malwa became incorporated into the dominions of the emperor of Delhi. In 1703 a Muslim convert of the Gond tribe held the country, and in 1743 Raghoji Bhonsle, the Maratha ruler of Berar, annexed it to his dominions.\r\n\r\nThe Marathas in the year 1818 ceded this district to the East India Company as payment for a contingent, and by the treaty of 1826 it was formally incorporated with the British possessions.[8] The district was administered as part of the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories until 1861, when the territories were incorporated into the Central Provinces. Betul District was also part of the Nerbudda (Narmada) Division of the Central Provinces and Berar, which became the state of Madhya Bharat (later Madhya Pradesh) after India''s independence in 1947.\r\n\r\nDetachments of British troops were stationed at Multai, Betul and Shahpur to cut off the retreat of Appa Sahib, the Maratha general, and a military force was quartered at Betul until June 1862. The ruined city of Kherla formed the seat of government under the Gonds and preceding rulers, and hence the district was, until the time of its annexation to the British dominions, known as the "Kherla Sarkar." The town of Multai contains an artificial tank, from the centre of which the Tapti is said to take its rise; hence the reputed sanctity of the spot, and the accumulation of temples in its honour.\r\n\r\nThis district suffered very severely from the famine of 1896–1897, in 1897 the death-rate being as high as 73 per 1000. It suffered again in 1900, when in May the number of persons relieved rose to one-third of the total population. In 1901 the population was 285,363, showing a decrease of 12% in the decade, due to the results of famine.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 the population of the town was 4,739. The administrative headquarters of the district were transferred to the town of Badnur, 3 miles north. At the beginning of the 20th century, the principal crops in the district were wheat, millet, other food-grains, pulse, oil-seeds, and a little sugar-cane and cotton\r\n\r\n<h3>Top Places Visit to In Belul</h3>\r\n\r\n<strong>Balajipuram temple\r\nEnchanting Lord Krishna''s statue at Mandir</strong>', 'Betul', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'betul', '', '', '2016-02-27 20:36:01', '2016-02-27 20:36:01', '', 0, 'http://www.mpinformation.com/?p=456', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Raja Ali Khan (1576-1596 A.D.), also known as Adil Shah, was asked to submit to Akbar, when the latter had sent an expedition to Khandesh, in the summer of 1577 A.D. The former, to avoid the unequal contest with the mighty Akbar, dropped his royal title of Shah and accepted the Suzerainty of Akbar.This marked an epoch in the Deccan policy of the Mughals, for Khandesh was used as a base for the future Conquest of Deccan. Raja Ali Khan constructed many buildings like Jama Masjid in the upper portion of the fort of Asir in 1588 A.D., Jama Masjid at Burhanpur in 1590 A.D., Idgah at Asir, mausoleums & Serai at Burhanpur and Serai & Mosque at Zainabad.\r\n\r\nBahadur Khan (1596-1600 A.D.) successor of Raja Ali Khan declared his independence & refused to pay homage to Akbar & his son Prince Daniyal, which enraged Akbar, who marched towards Burhanpur in 1599 and occupied the City without any opposition on 8th April 1600 A.D.

It stands picturesquely on the open Satpura plateau at an elevation of about 677 meters, flanked by ranges of low hills. With a comparatively light rainfall, the climate is very salubrious and pleasant. The name of the place is derived from the Chhind or date-palm tree.\r\nIt is said that one Ratan Raghuwanshi who came from Ayodhya and killed the Gaoli chief of this region founded Chhindwara. Then he let loose a goat and on the place where it lay down built a house, burying the goat alive under its foundations. A platform was erected afterwards on the spot. It is worshipped as the tutelary deity of the town. There is a ruined mud fort at Chhindwara, within which there is an old stone house, supposed to have been that of Ratan Raghuwanshi. A military force was stationed at Chhindwara before the Great Revolt of 1857-58. For a short period the house was used as a sanitarium for the Kamptee garrison.\r\n\r\n<h3>History</h3>\r\nIt is believed that once upon a time the Chhindwara District was full of "Chhind" (Date-Palm) trees, and the place was named "Chhind"-"Wada" (wada means place). There is also another story that because of the population of Lions (in Hindi it is called "Sinh"), it was considered that making entry into this district is akin to passing through the entrance of Lions'' den. Hence it was called "Sinh Dwara" (means through the entrance of lion). In due course of time it became "Chhindwara".\r\nHistory records the place from the time of the rule of Bhakth Bulund King, whose kingdom was spread over the Satpura range of hills and it is belived that his rule was upto the 3rd Century. One ancient plaque, belonging to "Rashtrakut" dynasty, found in "Neelkanth" village. This dynasty ruled upto the 7th Century. Then came the "Gondvana" dynasty which ruled the area with "Devgarh" as the capital. King ''Jatav'' of ''Gond'' community has built the Devgarh fort. Bhakth Bulund King was most powerful in the dynasty and he has adopted Muslim religion during the rule of Emperor "Aurangjeb". Later the power has changed many hands and finally ''Maratha rule'' ended in 1803. On 17 September 1803, East India Company had taken over this kingdom by defeating ''Raghuji II'', starting the British rule. After Independence ''Nagpur'' was made the capital of Chhindwara District, and on 1st November 1956 this district was re-constituted with Chhindwara as the capital.\r\n\r\n<h3>Top Places Visit in Chhindwara </h3>\r\n<strong>Deogarh Fort\r\nGotmar Mela Pandhurna\r\nPench National Park\r\nPatalkot\r\nPachmarhi\r\n</strong>', 'Chhindwara', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'chhindwara', '', '', '2016-02-28 09:48:06', '2016-02-28 09:48:06', '', 0, 'http://www.mpinformation.com/?p=471', 0, 'post', '', 0),

It is situated in the north-eastern part of the State and geographically located at 23 deg 09’ north latitude and 79 deg 03’ east longitude. The district is surrounded  by Sagar in the west, Narsinghpur & Jabalpur in the South, Chhatarpur in the North, Panna & Katni  in the east. \r\n\r\n<h3>History</h3>\r\nThis place has long history dating back to ancient times excavated. Stone Age tools found in Singrampur Valley are testimony to the fact that this place was the cradle of human civilization and habitat since millions of years. In more recent times, around the 5th century, it was part of mighty grand empire of Guptas of Pataliputra, It was established by the plaques and coins along with various monuments found in the region belonging to the reign of Samudragupta, Chandragupta, and Skandgupta. From the 8th to 12th centuries some parts of the Damoh district were parts of Chedi Empire ruled by Kalchuri dynasty from capital Tripuri.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent temple at Nohta is a living example of the glory of Kalchuries in the 10th century. Historical evidences also proves that some regions of the district were under the Chandels of the Jejak -Bhukti. The 14th century heralded the era of Muslim rule in the region and stone carving at Salaiya and Batiyagarh mention Khilzi and Tuglaq as Sultans. Later on, the Sultan of Malwa annexed the region into his fold. In the last quarter of the 15th century, Sangram Shah of Gond dynasty annexed the region into its dynamic and mighty empire consisting of 52 forts.\r\n\r\nIt was the era of peace and prosperity for the region. In Singrampur, Rani Durgawati attained martyrdom battling against the might of Mughal Empire represented by its General Asaf Khan along with his army. Her zeal to retain integrity and sovereignty of a kingdom is unparallel in world history. Bundelas entered into the region for a brief span after which Marathas took over the reigns in 1732 and remains The ruler uptill Britishers annexed Marathas kingdom after the death of Peshwa in 1888.', 'Damoh', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'damoh', '', '', '2016-02-28 10:12:24', '2016-02-28 10:12:24', '', 0, 'http://www.mpinformation.com/?p=473', 0, 'post', '', 0),

It was not considered expedient to locate the district headquarters at Guna, because of its being the British Cantonment. The old name of the district was Issagarh. In 1909 some districts were reorganised. As a result of this the headquarters of Issagarh district were shifted from Issagarh to Bajranggarh then a tahsil place. However Guna was made the headquarters of the district on November 5, 1922, as it was more suited than Bajranggarh in respect of basic infra-structural facilities. The Agra-Bombay road passing through Guna had already been there and the Midland Railway constructed the railway line passing Guna in 1897.\r\n\r\n<h3>Top Attraction Places in Guna</h3>\r\n<strong>Hanuman Tekri\r\nBees Bhuja Devi Temple\r\nBajranggarh\r\nGopi Sagar Sagar Dam</strong>', 'Guna', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'guna', '', '', '2016-02-28 11:39:05', '2016-02-28 11:39:05', '', 0, 'http://www.mpinformation.com/?p=482', 0, 'post', '', 0),

This archaeologically important site of antiquity is between the rivers Bes and Betwa. The site is mainly known for its ancient rock-cut temples excavated in an isolated stand stone hill and the numerous Buddhist remains in its neighbourhood. This isolated hill extends from North-West to South-East and is about a km. long, rising to a height of about 110m above the plain. Traces of some ancient buildings were also found here. These temples are known as Udaigiri. Some of these contain inscriptions, dated and undated, of considerable importance. The caves are mostly small chambers, enshrining idols or images of various dynasties carved into the rock of the hill. The caves and the other remains found at the site show that the site has passed through the influence of Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism in those days. An inscription in one of these, states that it was produced during the reign of Chandragupta-II (382-401 AD), thus dating these caves to 4-5 AD.\r\n \r\n<h3>History</h3>  \r\nThe caves possess all the distinctive features that gave Gupta art its unique vitality, vigour and richness of expression: the beautifully moulded capitals, the treatment of the intercolomination, the design of the entranceway and the system of continuing the architrave as a string-course round the structure.\r\nThey have been numbered probably according to the sequence in which they were excavated, beginning with Cave 1, which has a fontage adapted out of a natural ledge of rock, thus forming both the roof of the cella and its portico. The row of four pillars bear the ''vase and foliage'' pattern, of which the eminent art historian, Percy Brown, so eloquently says: "the Gupta capital typifies a renewal of faith, the water nourishing a plant trailing from its brim, an allegory which has produced the vase and flower motif, one of the most graceful forms in Indian architecture."\r\nCharacterised by richly carved facades and doorways, the shrines are progressively more spacious and more ornate. Cave No. 9 is remarkable for its large cell and massive, 8 feet high pillars, its long portico and pillared hall. Throughout, there is evidence that master craftsmen of Besnagar practiced their art with skill and artistry under the Guptas, four centuries later. Cave No. 5 is awe-inspiring in the sheer magnificence of the vision of its builders: here, a massive carving depicts Vishnu, in his Varaha (Boar) incarnation, holding the Earth Goddess Prithvi aloft upon one tusk. Yet another stupendous sculpture is of the reclining Vishnu.', 'Vidisha', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'vidisha', '', '', '2016-02-27 18:39:33', '2016-02-27 18:39:33', '', 0, 'http://www.mpinformation.com/?p=540', 0, 'post', '', 0),

These lakes not only add to the natural beauty of the area, but also provide a permanent source of water to the wildlife, and a fine wetland habitat to the aquatic fauna including thousands of migratory waterfowls. Marsh Crocodiles are in abundance in Sakhya sagar lake. Due to this, the lake looks like a "Crocodile Safari" and attracts special attention of tourists.\r\n\r\nThe park represents the Northern Tropical dry deciduous mixed forest type, as well as dry thorn forest, typical of North-Western Madhya Pradesh. The forests here are home to antelopes like Nilgai, Chinkara and Chowsinga and Deer including Chital, Sambar and Barking Deer. One can see animals like the Leopard, Wolf, Jackal, Fox, Wild Dog, Wild Pig, Porcupine, Marsh Crocodile and the Python.\r\n\r\nHaving a varied terrain of wooded hills, dry, mixed deciduous forests, and flat grasslands around the lakes, the park offers abundant opportunities of sighting a variety of wildlife.\r\n\r\nShivpuri town in the state of Madhya Pradesh was once the summer capital and the former hunting preserve of the Maharaja of Gwalior. Even before this, during the reign of the Mughals, its dense forests were the hunting grounds of the Mughal emperors. Large herds of elephants were captured here by Emperor Akbar. Since the area was a Royal shooting reserve, it was well protected, and abounded with wild life and was famous for its tigers. Tigers and other animals were known to wander in great numbers in the area. It is reported that in 1916, Lord Hardinge shot eight tigers in one day at Shivpuri. Lord Minto supposed to have shot 19 tigers during his trip to Gwalior state. The last of the resident wild tigers were seen in Madhav National Park around late 1970. Owing to dedicated efforts the habitat has become secure and improved now that the transient tigers are tempted to become resident. One male and one female tiger have once again made Madhav their home since october 2007.\r\n\r\nOn the shores of Sakhya Sagar lake which edges the forests, is a Boat Club, from where the park visitors can see a number of migratory birds especially in winter, when a large number of migratory waterfowls visit the area. A viewing lodge constructed  by the Maharaja called the Shooting Box, is situated above the Sakhya Sagar lake.  In the older days one could shoot wildlife, both with a gun and camera from here. Visitors could sit under cover and watch a tiger at a kill.\r\nAll around the lake (at suitable points), the Maharaja constructed boat landing areas, picnic shelters, watch towers, hides etc. and a network of well laid out metalled roads.\r\n\r\nDeep inside the Madhav National Park, at its highest point, stands the exquisite George Castle at a height of almost 484 m (1597 feet). Interestingly the castle was built by Jivaji Rao Scindia of the Gwalior royal family for an overnight halt for tiger  shooting by the British King George V, when he was to pass that way during his visit to India in 1911. Ironically, it so happened that the emperor could shoot a tiger on the way itself and did not stop at Madhav. Tunda Bharka spring, Bhura-kho spring and watch tower, and Churanchaj ancient wall paintings are beautiful sites to visit.\r\n\r\n<h2>Top Attraction Place in Shivpuri</h2>\r\n\r\n[gallery ids="349,346,352,351,347,348,350,339,341,345,340,344,343,342,345"]\r\n', 'Shivpuri', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '338-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-02-20 11:51:44', '2016-02-20 11:51:44', '', 338, 'http://www.mpinformation.com/338-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Gwalior has stood the test of time and your visit to Gwalior is sure to elevate your spirits. While you are in this city, ensure that you do not miss the following 5 places to visit in Gwalior.\r\n\r\n<h3>About Gwalior</h3>\r\nGwalior''s tradition as a royal capital continued until the formation of present day India, with the Scindias having their dynastic seat here. The magnificent mementoes of a glorious past have been preserved with care, giving Gwalior an appeal unique and timeless. Gwalior''s history is traced back to a legend. In 8 A.D, a chieftain called Suraj Sen was stricken by a deadly disease. He was cured by a hermit saint, Gwalipa, and in gratitude founded a city which he named after the saint who had given him the gift of new life. The new city of Gwalior became, over the centuries, the cradle of great dynasties and with each, the city gained new dimensions from warrior kings, poets, musicians and saints, contributing to making it a capital renowned throughout the country.Since then, Gwalior is considered to be a city where a rich cultural tradition has been interwoven into the fabric of modern life. Also where a princely past lives on in great palaces and their museums. And where a multitude of images merge and mix to present to the visitor a city of enduring greatness.\r\n\r\n<h3>TELI KA MANDIR</h3>\r\nThe Teli ka Mandir is a 9th century edifice, towering at 100 ft high. This is a Pratihara Vishnu temple of a unique blending of architectural styles. The shape of the roof is distinctively Dravidian, while the decorative embellishments have the typically Indo-Aryan characteristics of Northern India. Also dedicated to Vishnu is the graceful little Sas-Bahu-ka-Mandir, built in 11th century. Another landmark is the historic Gurudwara Data Bandhi Chhod built in the memory of Guru Hargobind Sahib, the 6th Sikh Guru who was imprisoned here by Jehangir for over two years. At the time of his release, he wanted 52 Hindu kings who were his fellow prisoners, released with him. Jehangir was very impressed with the Guru and agreed to his condition. And, finally, within the Fort complex, housed in the erstwhile barracks of the British soldiers, is Gwalior''s unique gift to modern India : Scindia School. Acknowledged as one of the finest schools in India, it is only fitting that the country''s young citizens receive the best educational grounding surrounded by monuments to a past which is a constant inspiration. \r\n\r\n<h3>JAI VILAS PALACE</h3>\r\nA splendour of a different kind exists in the Jai Vilas Palace, current residence of the Scindia family. Some 35 rooms have been made into the Scindia Museum, and in these rooms, so evocative of a regal lifestyle, the past comes alive. Jai Vilas is an Italianate structure which combines the Tuscan and Corinthian architectural modes. The imposing Darbar Hall has two central chandeliers, weighing a couple of tonnes, and hung only after ten elephants had tested the strength of the roof.\r\n\r\n<h3>Top places to visit in Gwalior</h3>\r\n[gallery ids="270,271,272,262"]', 'Gwalior', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '22-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-02-21 22:49:40', '2016-02-21 22:49:40', '', 22, 'http://www.mpinformation.com/22-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Nine years later the raja rebelled, but although with the help of the Bahmani kings of the Deccan he managed for a time to assert his independence, he was finally subdued and deprived of his territories. In 1467 Kherla was seized by the Bahmani sultan, but was afterwards restored to Malwa. A century later the kingdom of Malwa became incorporated into the dominions of the emperor of Delhi.

It is about 337 K.M from Bhopal via Amla and Itarsi and about 315 km via Hoshangabad. By rail the distance of the town is about 128 km from Nagpur. Chhindwara is connected with Nagpur, Seoni, Matkuli, Multai & Narsinghpur by good roads, all radiating from this place. It stands picturesquely on the open Satpura plateau at an elevation of about 677 meters, flanked by ranges of low hills. With a comparatively light rainfall, the climate is very salubrious and pleasant. The name of the place is derived from the Chhind or date-palm tree.\nIt is said that one Ratan Raghuwanshi who came from Ayodhya and killed the Gaoli chief of this region founded Chhindwara. Then he let loose a goat and on the place where it lay down built a house, burying the goat alive under its foundations. A platform was erected afterwards on the spot. It is worshipped as the tutelary deity of the town. There is a ruined mud fort at Chhindwara, within which there is an old stone house, supposed to have been that of Ratan Raghuwanshi. A military force was stationed at Chhindwara before the Great Revolt of 1857-58. For a short period the house was used as a sanitarium for the Kamptee garrison.\n\n<h3>History</h3>\nIt is believed that once upon a time the Chhindwara District was full of "Chhind" (Date-Palm) trees, and the place was named "Chhind"-"Wada" (wada means place). There is also another story that because of the population of Lions (in Hindi it is called "Sinh"), it was considered that making entry into this district is akin to passing through the entrance of Lions'' den. Hence it was called "Sinh Dwara" (means through the entrance of lion). In due course of time it became "Chhindwara".\nHistory records the place from the time of the rule of Bhakth Bulund King, whose kingdom was spread over the Satpura range of hills and it is belived that his rule was upto the 3rd Century. One ancient plaque, belonging to "Rashtrakut" dynasty, found in "Neelkanth" village. This dynasty ruled upto the 7th Century. Then came the "Gondvana" dynasty which ruled the area with "Devgarh" as the capital. King ''Jatav'' of ''Gond'' community has built the Devgarh fort. Bhakth Bulund King was most powerful in the dynasty and he has adopted Muslim religion during the rule of Emperor "Aurangjeb". Later the power has changed many hands and finally ''Maratha rule'' ended in 1803. On 17 September 1803, East India Company had taken over this kingdom by defeating ''Raghuji II'', starting the British rule. After Independence ''Nagpur'' was made the capital of Chhindwara District, and on 1st November 1956 this district was re-constituted with Chhindwara as the capital.\n<h3>Top Places Visit in Chhindwara </h3>\n\n', 'Chhindwara', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '471-autosave-v1', '', '', '2016-02-28 09:46:45', '2016-02-28 09:46:45', '', 471, 'http://www.mpinformation.com/471-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Stone Age tools found in Singrampur Valley are testimony to the fact that this place was the cradle of human civilization and habitat since millions of years. In more recent times, around the 5th century, it was part of mighty grand empire of Guptas of Pataliputra, It was established by the plaques and coins along with various monuments found in the region belonging to the reign of Samudragupta, Chandragupta, and Skandgupta. From the 8th to 12th centuries some parts of the Damoh district were parts of Chedi Empire ruled by Kalchuri dynasty from capital Tripuri.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent temple at Nohta is a living example of the glory of Kalchuries in the 10th century. Historical evidences also proves that some regions of the district were under the Chandels of the Jejak -Bhukti. The 14th century heralded the era of Muslim rule in the region and stone carving at Salaiya and Batiyagarh mention Khilzi and Tuglaq as Sultans. Later on, the Sultan of Malwa annexed the region into his fold. In the last quarter of the 15th century, Sangram Shah of Gond dynasty annexed the region into its dynamic and mighty empire consisting of 52 forts.\r\n\r\nIt was the era of peace and prosperity for the region. In Singrampur, Rani Durgawati attained martyrdom battling against the might of Mughal Empire represented by its General Asaf Khan along with his army. Her zeal to retain integrity and sovereignty of a kingdom is unparallel in world history. Bundelas entered into the region for a brief span after which Marathas took over the reigns in 1732 and remains The ruler uptill Britishers annexed Marathas kingdom after the death of Peshwa in 1888.', 'Damoh', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '473-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-02-28 10:12:24', '2016-02-28 10:12:24', '', 473, 'http://www.mpinformation.com/473-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Several ancient texts like Shiva Samhita and NaradPuran also make a reference to this area. Bandhavgarh owes its wilderness to erstwhile rulers of Rewa State, since it was their hunting preserve and enjoyed protection from wanton destruction. It was considered a good omen for the Rewa Maharaja to shoot 108 tigers, the numbers coinciding with the beads in the Hindu rosary! Bandhavgarh has three major attractions: wildlife archaeology and breathtaking landscape. Out of which wildlife is the principal one, with tigers being the star attraction that can be easily sighted in their various moods and behavioural patterns. Interesting territorial fights and land tenure patterns of tigers have been observed in the area.\r\nThe other common wild herbivores of Central India like Sambar, Chital (Spotted deer), Chowsingha, Nilgai and Chinkara. Other wild animals include the Sloth bear, jackal, hyena, langur, and more than 240 species of avifauna, apart from a large number of reptilian species. The reserve also has a sparse population of Gaur, which could be sighted in forest areas adjoining the reserve.\r\nThe must-visit places within the park include the Bandhavgarh Fort, the statue of reclining Vishnu (Sheshshaiya), Badi Gufa, Three Cave Point, Sita, Mandap, Raj Behra and Chakradhara.

The fort consists of a defensive structure and two main palaces, Gurjari Mahal and Man Mandir, built by Man Singh Tomar. The fort has been controlled by a number of different rulers in its history. The Gurjari Mahal palace was built for Queen Mrignayani. It is now an archaeological museum.\r\n<script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>\r\n<!-- HWDI -->\r\n<ins class="adsbygoogle"\r\n     style="display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px"\r\n     data-ad-client="ca-pub-8101934772482056"\r\n     data-ad-slot="2714697722"></ins>\r\n<script>\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n</script>\r\n<h3>HISTORY</h3>\r\nGwalior’s legendary beginning stems from a meeting between Suraj Sen & the hermit Gwalipa, who lived on the hilltop where the fort stands. When Suraj Sen asked for drinking water the recluse struck a rock & a cool clear spring gushed out & after having bath from that water Suraj Sen’s leprosy got cured. Then in gratitude king had built the tank from the fountain & named it Suraj Kund then later on the name changed to Suhan Pal & said his descendants would remain in power as long as they kept the name pal. His next 83 descendants did just that but number 84 changed his name to Tej Karan & said Good Bye to his kingdom. Then the Tomars came in to existence in 1398 & remained in power until 1505 when Ibrahim Lodi captured it. It was Raja Man Singh [1486-1516], the most illustrious of tomars, who built the magnificient palace Man Mandir here. The Mughals, under Babar later occupied the fort. The Marathas captured it in 1784 & then finally it came into the possession of the Scindias. During the First War of Independence in 1857, it witnessed a fierce battle when thousands of Indians fought against the British under the leadership of heroic Rani Lakshmi Bai of Jhansi, still in her twenties & tantya tope. It was here that Rani of Jhansi was killed fighting fiercely against heavy odds. A memorial statue is there of Rani of Jhansi.\r\n\r\n<h3>How to Reach :</h3>\r\n<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width="12%"><strong>By Air</strong></td>\r\n    <td width="88%">Gwalior Airport is the nearest one which is located at the distance of 8 km from the city.</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><strong>By Train</strong></td>\r\n    <td>Gwalior Railway Station is the nearest station to reach the city.</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><strong>By Road</strong></td>\r\n    <td>There are several tourist and private buses from Jhansi (108 Km), Bhopal (339 Km), Delhi (319 Km), Indore (169 km), and Jaipur (348 km), which are well connected to Gwalior.</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<h3>Best Time to Visit :</h3>\r\n<strong>Best Time to Visit:</strong> October to March is the best time to visit here as the weather remains pleasant.
